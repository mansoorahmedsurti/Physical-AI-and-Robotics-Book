# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — A Modern Technical Guide Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy through Primary Source Verification and Real-World Examples
All factual claims MUST be traceable to primary sources and supported by real-world examples for enhanced clarity and understanding.

### II. Clarity for Technical Audience
The content MUST be written with a clear, concise, and precise language, tailored for a technical audience including engineers, researchers, and enthusiasts with a STEM background.

### III. Reproducibility
All technical claims, code, and experiments presented MUST be reproducible. This requires including explicit citations and traceable links to datasets, code repositories (e.g., GitHub), CAD files, or simulation tools where applicable.

### IV. Rigor
The content MUST demonstrate academic and technical rigor, prioritizing peer-reviewed sources, and supplementing with reputable industry reports and patents.

### V. Ethical AI and Robotics Focus
Discussions MUST integrate ethical considerations related to AI and robotics, addressing safety, bias, societal impact, and adherence to human-robot interaction guidelines.

### VI. Comprehensiveness
The guide MUST provide comprehensive coverage across hardware, software, system integration, and future trends in the field of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

### VII. Engagement
The content MUST be engaging for the reader, utilizing visual aids such as diagrams, practical case studies, and hands-on tutorials.

## Key Standards

- All factual claims MUST be traceable to sources.
- Citation format: Chicago style (author-date) for books.
- Source types: Minimum 40% peer-reviewed articles, plus books, patents, conference proceedings, and reputable industry whitepapers.
- Plagiarism check: 0% tolerance before submission.
- Writing clarity: Flesch-Kincaid grade 12-14.
- Reproducibility: Include links to datasets, code repositories (e.g., GitHub), CAD files, or simulation tools where applicable.
- Visual aids: Minimum 20 figures/diagrams per chapter, with captions and sources.
- Up-to-date content: Incorporate developments up to 2025, with a section on emerging trends.

## Constraints

- Word count: 80,000-120,000 words.
- Minimum 50 sources.
- Format: PDF or ePub with embedded citations, index, glossary, and bibliography.
- Chapter structure: At least 10 chapters, including introduction, core technical sections, ethics/safety, and future outlook.

## Success Criteria

- All claims MUST be verified against sources.
- Zero plagiarism MUST be detected.
- The content MUST pass fact-checking review by domain experts.
- Positive feedback from beta readers or simulated peer review is expected.
- Completeness: The guide MUST cover key subtopics like sensor fusion, locomotion algorithms, embodiment in AI, and humanoid design principles.
- Reader engagement: The guide MUST achieve high readability scores and include practical exercises or projects.

## Governance

This Constitution supersedes all other project practices. Amendments require thorough documentation, approval by project stakeholders, and a clear migration plan for any affected processes or artifacts. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles.
